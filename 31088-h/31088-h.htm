<h2>Taxonomy and Distribution<br />
of Some American Shrews</h2>

<h4>by James S. Findley</h4>


<p><i><b>Sorex cinereus ohionensis</b></i> Bole and Moulthrop.&mdash;In their description of
this subspecies from Ohio, Bole and Moulthrop (1942:89-95) made no
mention of specimens in the United States Biological Surveys Collection
from Ellsworth and Milford Center, Ohio, which stand in the literature
(see Jackson, 1928:49) as <i>Sorex cinereus cinereus</i>. These two
localities lie south of the geographic range ascribed to <i>S. c.
ohionensis</i> by Bole and Moulthrop. Examination of the two specimens,
United States Biological Surveys Collection, Catalogue No. 70566, and
United States National Museum, No. 19434, respectively, both of which
are alcoholics, reveals that they are referable to the subspecies
<i>ohionensis</i> rather than to <i>S. c. cinereus</i>. This reference is made on
the basis of small size, short tail (33 and 31 millimeters,
respectively), and fourth upper unicuspid as large as third (the
specimen from Milford Center lacks the skull). The occurrence at Milford
Center provides a southward extension of known range for <i>S. c.
ohionensis</i> of approximately 70 miles. <i>S. c. cinereus</i> seems not to
occur in Ohio.</p>

<p><i><b>Cryptotis micrura</b></i> (Tomes).&mdash;Davis (1944:376) assigned a <i>Cryptotis</i>
from Boca del R&iacute;o, Veracruz, to <i>Cryptotis parva berlandieri</i> (Baird).
Comparison of this specimen, Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collections, No.
2765, with 8 specimens of <i>C. micrura</i> from various parts of northern
Veracruz and with 9 <i>C. parva</i> from southern Tamaulipas reveals that the
shrew from Boca del R&iacute;o is referable to <i>Cryptotis micrura</i>. The series
of 8 specimens in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History
from Altamira, Tamaulipas, provides the southernmost known record of
<i>Cryptotis parva berlandieri</i>. These 8 specimens are typical of <i>C. p.
berlandieri</i> and show no approach to <i>C. micrura</i>. Average and extreme
cranial measurements of 7 specimens from 1 mi. S Altamira are:
condylobasal length, 15.6 (15.2-16.1); palatal length, 6.6 (6.4-6.7);
maxillary tooth-row, 5.7 (5.4-5.8); cranial breadth, 7.6 (7.4-8.0);
least interorbital breadth, 3.5 (3.4-3.7); maxillary breadth, 5.0
(4.8-5.2). Cranial measurements of 8 specimens of <i>C. micrura</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[Pg 616]</a></span> from
various localities in northern Veracruz (1 km. E Mecayucan, 1; 7 km. NNW
Cerro Gordo, 3; Teocelo, 2; 7 km. W El Brinco, 1; 5 km. N Jalapa, 1)
are: condylobasal length, 17.1 (16.6-17.4); palatal length, 7.1
(6.9-7.4); maxillary tooth-row, 6.2 (5.9-6.4); cranial breadth, 8.5
(8.3-8.6); least interorbital breadth, 3.7 (3.6-4.1); maxillary breadth,
5.3 (5.1-5.6). <i>C. parva</i> and <i>C. micrura</i> may intergrade but a distance
of 140 miles separates the geographic ranges as now known of the two
kinds and every specimen examined by me is clearly referable to one or
the other of the two named kinds and shows no evidence of
intergradation.</p>

<p><i><b>Notiosorex crawfordi crawfordi</b></i> Baird.&mdash;A specimen in the Museum of
Natural History from Jaumave, and one from Palmillas, Tamaulipas,
collected by Gerd Heinrich, provide records of the easternmost margin of
the range of this species in Mexico. Assignment is made to the
subspecies <i>crawfordi</i> on geographic grounds. The two specimens differ
from a male from 13 mi. S and 15 mi. W Guadalajara, Jalisco, referred
(Twente and Baker, 1951:121) to <i>N. c. evotis</i> (Coues) in slightly
larger size; however two skulls from owl pellets from 21 mi. SW
Guadalajara, also referred to <i>evotis</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), seem to me to
differ in no important way from skulls of the Tamaulipan specimens.
Measurements of the Tamaulipan specimens, both females, 54932 KU and
54933 KU, are respectively: condylobasal length, &mdash;, 16.7; palatal
length, &mdash;, 7.2; maxillary tooth-row, 6.6, 6.1; cranial breadth, 8.3,
8.1; least interorbital breadth, &mdash;, 3.5; maxillary breadth, &mdash;, 5.1;
total length, 90, 90; tail, 28, 30; hind foot, 11.0, 11.5; ear, 8, 8.</p>

<p>The only other eastern Mexican record of <i>N. crawfordi</i> is based on two
skulls from owl pellets collected 3 mi. NW Cuatro Cienegas, Coahuila
(Baker, 1953:253).</p>

<p><i><b>Sorex oreopolus emarginatus</b></i> Jackson.&mdash;A first-year female <i>Sorex</i>, KU
54346, obtained by Rollin H. Baker from 7 mi. SW Las Adjuntas, 8900 ft.,
Durango, seems closest, among Mexican shrews that I have examined, to
two specimens of <i>S. emarginatus</i> from Plateado, 7600 to 8500 ft.,
Zacatecas. Measurements of the Las Adjuntas specimen are: total length,
88; tail, 39; hind foot, 13; palatal length, 7.2; maxillary tooth-row,
6.4; maxillary breadth, 4.9; least interorbital breadth, 3.6.</p>

<p><i>Sorex emarginatus</i> previously was known only from Plateado and the type
locality, Bolanos, Jalisco. Comparison of these three specimens with
specimens of other species of Mexican shrews of the <i>S. saussurei</i> group
leads me to conclude that the group contains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[Pg 617]</a></span> two species rather than
four as was previously thought. <i>Sorex emarginatus</i>, <i>S. ventralis</i>, and
<i>S. oreopolus</i> seem to me to be conspecific. All three nominal species
are relatively small, short-tailed shrews. The skulls of the three kinds
resemble one another in relatively short rostrum and in dental details.
Slight differences in cranial proportions differentiate the three and
they should, until more specimens of each are obtained and studied,
retain subspecific rank. The specific name, <i>Sorex oreopolus</i> Merriam
1892, should apply to the three kinds since it antedates the names
<i>ventralis</i> and <i>emarginatus</i>. The two names last given, therefore,
should stand as <i>Sorex oreopolus ventralis</i> Merriam and <i>Sorex oreopolus
emarginatus</i> Jackson. The two species, the large <i>S. saussurei</i>, and the
small <i>S. oreopolus</i>, as the latter is here understood, occur together
over an extensive region in southern Mexico. In other parts of North
America a large and a small species of <i>Sorex</i> often occur together in a
given area.</p>

<p>The Las Adjuntas specimen was taken only 10 miles southwest of El Salto,
Durango, the type locality of <i>S. durangae</i> Jackson. Jackson (1928:101)
placed <i>durangae</i> in the <i>Sorex vagrans-obscurus</i> species group, but the
two specimens available to him were second year adults with the teeth so
much worn that diagnostic characters are not visible on them. I have
examined these two specimens (United States Biological Surveys
Collection 94539 and 94540) and find that in bodily and cranial
proportions they resemble <i>Sorex s. saussurei</i>, and I so assign them.</p>

<p><i><b>Sorex milleri</b></i> Jackson.&mdash;Koestner (1941:10) reported 5 <i>Sorex</i> from
Cerro Potos&iacute;, near La Jolla, Municipio de Galeana, Nuevo Leon, as <i>Sorex
emarginatus</i>. Comparison of 4 of these specimens (Chicago Museum of
Natural History, 48227, 48228, 48229, 48230) with two <i>S. emarginatus</i>
from Plateado, Zacatecas, and specimens of other species of <i>Sorex</i>
indicates that the Cerro Potos&iacute; shrews differ in many features from
<i>emarginatus</i>, but closely resemble, in size and cranial characters, a
specimen (F. W. Miller, No. 20) of <i>S. milleri</i> from Sierra del Carmen,
Coahuila, and seems to be referable to that species which was not named
when Koestner (<i>loc. cit.</i>) recorded his specimen. The range of <i>S.
milleri</i> is therefore extended southwestward to western central Nuevo
Leon.</p>

<p>Comparison of <i>S. milleri</i> with specimens of other species of North
American <i>Sorex</i> leads me to conclude that <i>S. milleri</i> is most closely
related to<i> S. cinereus</i> Kerr, and should be included in the <i>S.
cinereus</i> group rather than in the <i>S. vagrans-obscurus</i> group.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[Pg 618]</a></span> <i>Sorex
cinereus</i> and <i>S. milleri</i> are alike, and both differ from even the
smallest <i>S. vagrans</i> in relatively long and narrow rostrum, narrow
teeth, smaller skull, and in having the third upper unicuspid more often
equal to or smaller than, rather than larger than, the fourth unicuspid.</p>

<p>I judge <i>S. milleri</i> to be a relict population of <i>S. cinereus</i>,
isolated in the mountains of northeastern Mexico, probably in the late
Pleistocene. <i>Sorex cinereus</i> reported from Pleistocene deposits in San
Josecito Cave, Nuevo Leon (Findley, 1953:635), probably represents a
population ancestral to the modern <i>S. milleri</i>. <i>Sorex milleri</i> should
retain specific status because of constant cranial differences from <i>S.
cinereus</i>, particularly relatively broader rostrum.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
